***

## Run the package

Several *.launch* files are available to run the package, you can do a first try with:
```sh
$ roslaunch ontologenius ontologenius_full.launch
```

On this launcher file, you will find an argument indicating the path to the ontology files.
> The default ontologies are very simple and I encourage you to contribute to their development!

You can add your own ontology files in the argument if you want them to be loaded at the beginning of the program.
